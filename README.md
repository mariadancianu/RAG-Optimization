# RAG Optimization Experiments on the SQuAD Dataset

![RAG Optimization](rag.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a series of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** optimization experiments conducted for learning and research purposes.

The focus is on improving retrieval quality and generation performance using the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

To overcome CPU limitations and the lack of GPUs, I  explored using [Replicate](https://replicate.com) to run the experiments on the cloud, which allowed for efficient execution of large language models. Replicate is user-friendly and simplifies running large language models. While it is a paid service, the cost of running some simple experiments is limited.

To provide an interactive experience with my optimized RAG models, I have developed a **Streamlit application** that allows users to engage directly with the RAG-based chatbot. Additionally, this project serves as an opportunity to learn how Streamlit works and how to build a web application from scratch.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goal of these experiments is to understand how to optimize effectively the various components of a RAG pipeline, including retrieval quality, embeddings, and response generation.

The experiments in this repository explore:

- Optimizing RAG architectures to enhance information retrieval.
- Evaluating different embedding models and vector database configurations.
- Optimizing the retrieval process to improve answer accuracy.
- Testing various chunking strategies for document preprocessing.
