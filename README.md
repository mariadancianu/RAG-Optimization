## RAG Fine-Tuning Experiments on the SQuAD Dataset

This repository contains a series of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fine-tuning experiments conducted for learning and research purposes. The focus is on improving retrieval quality and generation performance using the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

### Overview

The experiments in this repository explore:

- Fine-tuning RAG architectures to enhance information retrieval.
- Evaluating different embedding models and vector database configurations.
- Optimizing the retrieval process to improve answer accuracy.
- Testing various chunking strategies for document preprocessing.

### Dataset

The SQuAD dataset is used as the knowledge source for retrieval. The dataset consists of question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles, making it a great benchmark for assessing retrieval-augmented models.

### Objective

The primary goal of these experiments is to understand how to fine-tune a RAG pipeline effectively and optimize various components, including retrieval quality, embeddings, and response generation.
