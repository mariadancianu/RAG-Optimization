# RAG Fine-Tuning Experiments on the SQuAD Dataset


## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fine-tuning experiments conducted for learning and research purposes.

The focus is on improving retrieval quality and generation performance using the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goal of these experiments is to understand how to fine-tune a RAG pipeline effectively and optimize various components, including retrieval quality, embeddings, and response generation.

The experiments in this repository explore:

- Fine-tuning RAG architectures to enhance information retrieval.
- Evaluating different embedding models and vector database configurations.
- Optimizing the retrieval process to improve answer accuracy.
- Testing various chunking strategies for document preprocessing.
